Benefits
---------------
- full browser compatibility *(ie6+,chrome,safari,opera,firefox)*;
- responsible design
- one full page loading, *and then just one-time json-dir-listings loading
(with refresh opportunity).*
- caching readed directories *to localStorage (for now)
(so if network will disconnected or something heppen with a signal, we
definitely will can work cached copy of directory listings)*;
- key binding
- disabled js support *(working in limited mode)*.
- automated minification *client js-files and onstart-reading Cloud manager files on server starting.*

**Cloud Commander** uses all benefits of js, so if js is disabled,
we moves to *limited mode*.

Limited-mode features:
---------------
- only 1 panel available
- no keybinding
- no local caching
- full loading of all web page(with styles, js-scripts, html-page etc).

Hot keys:
---------------
In all modern web browsers (but not in IE, becouse he special) hot keys works.
There is a short list:
- Ctrl + r          - reload dir content
- Ctrl + d          - clear local cache (wich contains dir contents)
- Alt  + q          - disable key bindings
- Alt  + s          - get all key bindings back
- up, down, enter   - filesystem navigation
